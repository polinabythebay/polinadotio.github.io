<p>Let&rsquo;s go over organizing your interview process like a boss.</p>

<h3 id="part-one-organization">Part One: Organization</h3>

<p>Keep track of your interviews as they navigate through different states. I&rsquo;ve tried using both Asana and Trello, and find Trello to work very well. Based on my experience interviewing, these are the possible states:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Applied</strong>: Online, Referral, or Career Fair/Hiring Network.</li>
<li><strong>Coding Challenge</strong>: HackerRank timed toy problem(s), multiple choice, or take home project.</li>
<li><strong>Phone Screen Recruiter</strong>: Behavioral interview.</li>
<li><strong>Phone Screen Hiring Manager</strong>: Professional background, trivia web/cs questions, personal projects.</li>
<li><strong>Phone Screen Coding</strong>: CoderPad shared live coding or verbally explain toy problem algorithm with an engineer.</li>
<li><strong>Onsite</strong>: Whiteboarding algorithms/systems design, behavioral, live coding/pairing, presenting/extending project.</li>
<li><strong>Offer</strong>: Compensation, base salary, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Completed</strong>: no longer in the interviewing process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Link to <a href="https://trello.com/b/4eJNcg7E/interviewing-trello-board">Trello template</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/img/articles/trello.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%;max-height: 100%"></p>

<p>####How to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number your apps to keep track of how many you&rsquo;ve done. You&rsquo;ll be able to see the last number in your Trello history stream.</li>
<li>Paste the job title and copy of description of job in the card to be able to reference job description later: I&rsquo;ve found that companies will sometimes take down the job description and then 2 weeks later ask for an interview and at that point I would have forgotten what I had applied to, so document it! It also helps to have it in front of you when you&rsquo;re interviewing.</li>
<li>Document your entire process with a company in card comments: what went well, what didn&rsquo;t go well, what questions were asked, when did you last ping them, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>####Google Drive</p>

<p>In addition to tracking, it&rsquo;s incredibly important that you keep all of your application and interviewing materials organized and up to date. This is what worked for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resume (PDF)</li>
<li>Resume (Original)</li>
<li>Resumes

<ul>
<li>Previous Iterations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cover Letters

<ul>
<li>Cover Letter Template</li>
<li>One tailored cover letter per company applied</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Email Templates

<ul>
<li>Scheduling</li>
<li>Rejection</li>
<li>Thank Yous</li>
<li>Negotiation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Behavioral Phone Screen Worksheet</li>
<li>Angelist Template</li>
<li>Apps and Questionnaires (custom applications, ex. essay questions/multiple choice)</li>
<li>Company List/Notes</li>
<li>Recruiter Screen Notes</li>
<li>Personal Project Review</li>
<li>Additional Phone Screen Notes to help you feel prepared</li>
</ul>

<p>####Github</p>

<ul>
<li>Algorithms and toy problem repo</li>
</ul>

<p>I found that redoing toy problems and seeing my progression through them/doing them in different ways was very helpful. Documenting my toy problem process on Github was also satisfying and kept me motivated to do it at least once a day.</p>

<h3 id="part-two-execution">Part Two: Execution</h3>

<p><strong>Applications</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initially apply to up to 5 a day. Start at 5 or more a day in the first couple weeks.</li>
<li>When you have just about as many companies as you feel comfortable interviewing with at a given time, stop sending applications or keep it to 1-2 a day. This will depend on the individual, but I wouldn&rsquo;t ramp up applying again until you have less active interviews in your funnel than you&rsquo;d like.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phone Screens</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>One hour warmup (Interviewing is a performance. Figure out what works for you).</li>
<li>I schedule phone interviews in the mornings (9am-12pm). Figure out if there&rsquo;s a good time of day for you.</li>
<li>I have a sheet of paper with me with the name of the interviewer(s) written on it, the name of the company, a reference of the job description handy, a reference of my notes pertaining to the kind of interview, and a list of questions specific to the company.</li>
<li>Make sure you have a glass of water.</li>
<li>I put my phone on speakerphone, which works pretty well for me and lets me take notes. Some people prefer nice headphones.</li>
<li>I also have my computer handy and a copy of my resume. Sometimes a recruiter/hiring manager will want you to take a look at something online in the middle of the interview.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Onsite</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Bring a folder with you to the onsite and your computer/power cord.</li>
<li>Bring extra copies of your resume.</li>
<li>Bring a water bottle.</li>
</ul>
