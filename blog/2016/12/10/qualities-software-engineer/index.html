<p>To be a good software engineer is to engage in a creative, design-oriented activity that is done in a rigorous, systematic way. You are a code whisperer and you care about your end users and your current and future teammates! And yes, sometimes it&rsquo;s confusing and scary and oh god, why is the server melting.</p>

<p>####You are comfortable working with complexity</p>

<p>Computational systems are machines involving immense complexity. That complexity can be mastered intellectually with one tool: abstraction. You should enjoy ignoring some of the details and solving higher order problems. Breaking down the complexity to a level anyone reading your code can easily reason about is key to being a good software engineer. You will be tasked with ensuring a system functions properly without understanding the implementation details of every part.</p>

<p>Since everything is complex, when you&rsquo;re solving problems you must enjoy taking a logical and thoughtful approach to them.</p>

<p>####You care about good user-centered design</p>

<p>A user should not have to understand HTTP status codes to ascertain the state of your website. You must care about making something that a user wants to use. That means not repeating yourself, solving a problem once, write code that does on thing well, and focus on maintainability. That also means remembering that YOU won&rsquo;t be using the software. You also care about writing tests, you fix bugs before writing new code, you do usability testing, you use source control, you have a clearly defined spec, and you use the best tools for the problem.</p>

<p>####You care about best practices</p>

<p>Dolphins cannot run in environments they were not compiled for. You must be passionate about seeking out <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/best-practices">best practices</a> and contributing to a culture of <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review">good code review</a> and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">better code</a>.</p>

<p>####You are comfortable with uncertainty</p>

<p><img src="/img/articles/uncertainty.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;max-height: 100%"></p>

<p>You must always be learning from your mistakes and learning from others. The field is always changing and the inputs you&rsquo;re designing for will never perfectly match the inputs in reality. You should enjoy solving problems with uncertainty in mind.</p>

<p>Becoming a good software engineer means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Putting in the time and effort. You&rsquo;re always learning and practicing.</li>
<li>Asking questions and learning the same thing from multiple perspectives. If you need to understand something to complete a task, scour the web for tutorials. Try different tutorials. Some will make it click more than others.</li>
<li>Being involved in the community. Go to talks, become a mentor. Work on puzzles and put them on github. Start a blog. Start a portfolio.</li>
<li>Imposter syndrome will follow you throughout your career, and the more you learn about programming, the further behind you&rsquo;ll feel. That&rsquo;s okay, you&rsquo;re not being hired to know and do everything programming-related. You&rsquo;re being hired for a very specific set of skills which add value to a company.</li>
<li>Patience. Do not be afraid to fail 100 times before getting something to work correctly. Keep trying and don&rsquo;t give up!</li>
</ul>
